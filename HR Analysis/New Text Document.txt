Steps: 


-- 1.) DUPLICATE DATASET **** DONE ***
-- 2.0) CHANGE THE "id" name to "emp_id"
-- 2.1) STANDARDIZE DATA TYPES
-- 3.0) ADD COLUMN - "age"
-- 3.1) CLEAN THE OUTLIERS such as NEGATIVE Values
-- 4.) ANSWER EVERY QUESTION FOR ANALYSIS



Steps made: 

* Duplicate dataset - Created a table with similar columns ("hr_dataset_dupli"), and inserted all the values from the original dataset ("human resource").
* Changed the column name "ï»¿id" to new name "emp_id". Changed also the data type from "Text" to "VARCHAR(20)".

** The data on the birthdate && hire_date have "/" instead of "-". Checked every single data, converted the inconsistent data from string date to MM/DD/YYYY format to a DATE object using 		STR_TO_DATE, and then format it to the standard YYYY-MM-DD format using DATE_FORMAT.
** SINCE hire_date & birthdate are changed to object, change the data type FROM text to DATE.

** The data on the "termdate" are like '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s UTC'. Updated the values to date only format like `YYYY-MM-DD`. 
** Since there are a lot of blank data on the termdate, NULL Values are inserted to change the data type from "text" to "DATE" effectively.

*** ADDED 'age' column for analysis. Then subtracted the difference of the birthdates and current date to get the age in terms of Years.
		After the calculation, there were negative ages (like -40). Classified the Minimum and Maximum ages, then counted the outliers ((-) values) to exclude from analysis.


EXTRA CURICULARS:
* Replaced NULL values to (0000-00-00) in termdate indicating that they are still in the job.




CHALLENGES: 

* Cannot detect the NULL in the termdate column as NULL even visible. Disabled the Strict Mode to effectively change. 


SOLUTIONS FOR THE ASNWERS: 

-- What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
	** Counted every workers in each gender that are ages 18 and above that are still active.

-- What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
	** Counted every workers in each race that are ages 18 and above that are still active.

-- What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
	** Identified every single ages together with the gender, and labeled depending on the range.

-- How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
	** Counted each workers in each locations that are ages 18 and above that are still active.

-- What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
	** Got the difference of the termdate and hire date and divided by 365 (for approximation in terms of Years of active service), 
		filtered ages 18 and above and that are not active and the terminated on or before the current date.

-- How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
	** Got the Gender, department, and count the workers in every department ages 18 and above that are still active.

-- What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
	** Got the jobtitle, and count the workers in every jobtitles ages 18 and above that are still active.


-- Which department has the highest turnover rate?
	** Created a dynamic column for total_count, terminated_count to calaculate the termination rate which is the quotient of the two
		dynamic column. In line to that, a subquery to get the values for the dynamic columns.

-- What is the distribution of employees across locations by state?
	** Counted every active and 18 above workers across different states.


-- How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
	** Created dynamic columns - year (year from hire_date extracted), terminations, hire - terminations AS net_change, round((hires - 		terminations)/hires * 100, 2) AS net_change_percentage - which got from the subquery.



-- What is the tenure distribution for each department?

	** Got the number of days between hire_date and term_date, then convert it to years.
